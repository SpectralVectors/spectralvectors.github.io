A lifelong learner, in both academic and informal settings, I have acquired a broad skillset, including:

Python and Web development

Television, film and podcast production pipelines

IT and tech support across a broad range of devices, operating systems and user experience levels

Music composition, performance and instruction

3D design, animation, CAD & CAM/CNC

I am eager to support open-source software: to break down the barriers that slow or prevent adoption, and facilitate logical workflows that are intuitive to the end user.

I am always ready to learn new skills, and look forward to sharing my knowledge with others, and learning from them, in turn.
